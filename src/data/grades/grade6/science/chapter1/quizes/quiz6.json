      "options": ["Burning of paper", "Rusting of iron", "Melting of ice", "Cooking food"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Melting of ice is a physical change because it only changes the state of water from solid to liquid, without forming a new substance."

        "Reversible change",
        "Temporary change"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Formation of rust is a chemical change because it involves a reaction between iron and oxygen to form a new substance (iron oxide)."

      "question": "Which of these is a reversible change?",
      "options": ["Burning of wood", "Cooking of food", "Melting of wax", "Rusting of iron"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Melting of wax is a reversible change because the wax can be melted and solidified again without forming a new substance."

        "Reversible change",
        "Temporary change"

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Ripening of fruits is a chemical change because it involves changes in the chemical composition of the fruit."

      "question": "Which of these is an irreversible change?",
      "options": ["Melting of ice", "Evaporation of water", "Burning of paper", "Dissolving salt in water"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Burning of paper is an irreversible change because the paper cannot be converted back to its original form after burning."

        "Reversible change",
        "Temporary change"

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Formation of curd from milk is a chemical change because it involves the conversion of milk into a new substance (curd) through bacterial action."

      "question": "Which of these is a temporary change?",
      "options": ["Burning of wood", "Rusting of iron", "Melting of ice", "Cooking of food"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Melting of ice is a temporary change because it can be reversed by cooling the water back to ice."

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Formation of clouds is a physical change because it only involves a change in the state of water from liquid to gas and back to liquid."

      "question": "Which of these is a permanent change?",
      "options": ["Melting of ice", "Evaporation of water", "Burning of wood", "Dissolving salt in water"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Burning of wood is a permanent change because the wood cannot be converted back to its original form after burning."
