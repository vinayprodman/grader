      "question": "Which of these is a property of metals?",
      "options": ["Brittle", "Good conductor of heat", "Transparent", "Soft"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, while they are not brittle, transparent, or soft."

      "question": "What property makes a material float on water?",
      "options": [
        "High density",
        "Low density",
        "High weight",
        "Large size"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Materials with low density float on water because they are lighter than water."
    },

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of these is a transparent material?",
      "options": ["Wood", "Glass", "Metal", "Plastic"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Glass is transparent as it allows light to pass through it, while wood, metal, and most plastics are opaque."

      "question": "What property makes a material magnetic?",
      "options": [
        "High density",
        "Contains iron",
        "Good conductor",
        "High melting point"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Materials containing iron or other magnetic elements can be attracted by magnets."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of these is a property of non-metals?",
      "options": ["Malleable", "Ductile", "Brittle", "Good conductor"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Non-metals are generally brittle, meaning they break easily when hit, unlike metals which are malleable and ductile."
    },

      "id": 6,
      "question": "What property makes a material soluble in water?",
      "options": [
        "High density",
        "Low density",
        "Ability to dissolve",
        "High melting point"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Soluble materials can dissolve in water, forming a solution."

      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which of these is a property of plastics?",
      "options": ["Conducts electricity", "Biodegradable", "Water-resistant", "Magnetic"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Plastics are water-resistant, which is why they are used to make containers and waterproof materials."

      "id": 8,
      "question": "What property makes a material a good insulator?",
      "options": [
        "High conductivity",
        "Low conductivity",
        "High density",
        "Low density"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Good insulators have low conductivity, meaning they don't allow heat or electricity to pass through easily."
    },

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which of these is a property of rubber?",
      "options": ["Rigid", "Elastic", "Brittle", "Conductive"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Rubber is elastic, meaning it can stretch and return to its original shape."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What property makes a material a good conductor of electricity?",
      "options": [
        "High density",
        "Low density",
        "Free electrons",
        "High melting point"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Good conductors of electricity have free electrons that can move easily, allowing electric current to flow."
